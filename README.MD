Vou deixar alguns passos do repositório original aqui:

### Before you begin

- [x] Join [React Brasil](https://react-brasil-slack.herokuapp.com), if you haven't already.

### Technical requirements

Create a GraphQL server

- [x] respect the [relay server specification](https://relay.dev/docs/en/graphql-server-specification)

Create a React app (web and/or mobile)

- [x] it should use Relay Modern
- [x] it should be open sourced on your github repo

#### 1. Auth

On the **Auth** screen the user should be able to _Login and Register_.

#### 2. Create

On the **Create** screen the user should be able to _create a todo_ to be listed on the **List** screen.

#### 3. List

On the **List** screen the user should be able _to see_ every created todo with a _search bar_ and _a scroll_ to load more items.

#### 4. Detail

On pressing any **List item**, the user should be navigated to a **Detail** screen where he can see _more information_ about the selected todo.

#### 5. Ask for help :D

The challenge has no time limit
